**Thesis title**: _IoT Device for Electrocardiography Summary Statistics Monitoring_
**Submitted**: April 2018

## Project Aim:
The aim of this project was to propose and develop a solution to the problems associated with heart monitoring. The focus was on creating a novel solution for electrocardiography to provide preliminary or inital results, giving indidations of underlying cardiac issues so the patient can be referred to a cardiologist. The main consideration was to use low-cost components, which would allow the device to be used in a patient's home as well as in low income countries and regions.

The project focuses on two main objectives:
* The hardware used to capture/store the heart data.
* The softare used to analyse the patient's data, performing signal processing and unconver any underlying abnormalities.


## Motivation:
The motivation behind this project is about introducing a novel solution to the growing problem of cardiovascular (heart) diseases (CVDs). CVDs are the leading cause of mortality in the world, amounting to a total of approximately 17 million deaths globally - or 32% of all moralities. More than 80% are in low to middle-income countries such as parts of Asia, Eastern Europe and North Africa. Clearly, the less wealthy are more at risk because many do not have access to proper healthcare.

The ability to automate the monitoring process could help to reduce cardiovascular disease mortality rate, as well as to reduce the healthcare costs associated.
